Version 1.3 - Jan 7, 2014
 - Updated the way the headers fade in when upSlide.opts.fadingHeaders = true
	-- adding option to change the speed in which they fade in
 - Added support for moving slide onScroll
	-- needs jquery.mousewheel.js plugin ( https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel )
 - Added support to position thumbnails on left or right side
 - Added upSlide.previousSlide variable so you can do something with the previous slide
	-- not sure how helpful this will be for anyone, but it was necessary when I changed how the fadingHeaders() behaved
 - Added the ability to dynamically add/remove slides after creation
	-- it is a little tricky to do so but the result is awesome! ( I will include that functionality in the demo )

Version 1.2 - Jan 6, 2014
 - Completely removed dependencies on keeping location of slide in html
	-- it is now in a lookup array ( this.slideLookup )
 - class name cleanup
	-- more namespacing
 - plugin now returns itself so you can more easily adjust what slide to start on
 - better support for window resizing
 - allow for different colors on different slides for thumbnail
 - boolean variable for whether or not you want the thumbnail to match the current slide's header
	-- not fully supported; as it stands thumbIndicator.backgroundColor is used for both and must be set
	-- thumbIndicator.backgroundColor must be at least set to an empty array if you want to use randomly generated color
		--- without this it will not be given a background ( this will be fixed in the near future )
