Version 1.4 - Jan 12, 2014
 - Massive code cleanup {
	Added:
		createThumbnailWrapper();
		createThumbnailAndAddToArray(); ( not new but it now has a more efficient way of handling its business )
		createThumbnailIndicator();
 - Property names have been change to be for uniformed {
	thumb*      = thumbnail*
	thumbnails* = thumbnail*
	bsColorList = headerBackgroundColor ( still accepts an array of colors )
	headerTransparency = headerBackgroundTransparency
	
   }
 - Added property headerGenerateBackgroundColor (default:false)
	- if (true) : it will generate a background-color for headers that do not have one set for it
		ex. You have 5 slides but only list 3 colors; the plugin will generate 2 colors for the other slides
	- if (false) : it will cycle back through the list of declared color
		ex. You have 5 slides but only list 3 colors; the plugin will start the list of colors over 
		    after the 3rd slide {
			['red', 'green', 'yellow']
			slide1 = red;
			slide2 = green;
			slide3 = yellow;
			slide4 = red;
			slide5 = green; 
		    }
 - Added the ability to hide the title of the slide with the option to still have it show on the thumbnail
 - Fixed a bug slide waited twice as long on last slide
 - More support for resizing
 - JSHint checked
Version 1.3 - Jan 7, 2014
 - Updated the way the headers fade in when upSlide.opts.fadingHeaders = true
	-- adding option to change the speed in which they fade in
 - Added support for moving slide onScroll
	-- needs jquery.mousewheel.js plugin ( https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel )
 - Added support to position thumbnails on left or right side
 - Added upSlide.previousSlide variable so you can do something with the previous slide
	-- not sure how helpful this will be for anyone, but it was necessary when I changed how the fadingHeaders() behaved
 - Added the ability to dynamically add/remove slides after creation
	-- it is a little tricky to do so but the result is awesome! ( I will include that functionality in the demo )

Version 1.2 - Jan 6, 2014
 - Completely removed dependencies on keeping location of slide in html
	-- it is now in a lookup array ( this.slideLookup )
 - class name cleanup
	-- more namespacing
 - plugin now returns itself so you can more easily adjust what slide to start on
 - better support for window resizing
 - allow for different colors on different slides for thumbnail
 - boolean variable for whether or not you want the thumbnail to match the current slide's header
	-- not fully supported; as it stands thumbIndicator.backgroundColor is used for both and must be set
	-- thumbIndicator.backgroundColor must be at least set to an empty array if you want to use randomly generated color
		--- without this it will not be given a background ( this will be fixed in the near future )
